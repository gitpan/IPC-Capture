=head1 NAME

IPC::Capture - portably run external apps and capture the output

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use IPC::Capture;
   my $acc = IPC::Capture->new();
   $acc->set_output_director('stdout_only');

   my $output;
   if ( $output = $acc->run( $this_cmd ) || $acc->success ) {
      # ... work with $output, even if it's a "false" value, like undef
   }

   my $output;
   if ( $output = $acc->run( $this_cmd )  ) {
     die "Couldn't run $this_cmd" if ( not( $acc->success ) );
     # ... work with $output, if we haven't thrown an error.
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

IPC::Capture is a module for running external applications
in a portable fashion when you're primarily interested in capturing
the returned output.

Essentially this is an attempt at creating a portable way of doing a
"qx" with io-redirection.  In fact, typically it will internally try
to run the command via a sub-shell invoked by qx, if it looks like
that will work: if not it tries some other approaches which may work
if modules such as L<IPC::Cmd> and L<IPC::Run> are installed.

These different approaches to running external commands are called
"ways" here (because terms like "methods" already have different
associations).  At present, there are only two "ways" defined in
this module: "qx" and "ipc_cmd".  We will probe the system trying
each of the known ways (in the order defined in the "ways" attribute),
and use the first one that looks like it will work.

=item new

Creates a new IPC::Capture object.

Takes a hashref as an argument, with named fields identical
to the names of the object attributes (which also may be set
later via the accessor methods). These attributes are:

=over

=item output_director

The "output_director" is a code that specifies what command output
streams we're interested in capturing.  Allowed values:

=over

=item stdout_only

Discards stderr and returns only stdout.  Like the Bourne shell
redirect: '2>/dev/null'

=item stderr_only

Discards stdout and returns only stderr. Like the Bourne shell
redirect: '2>&1 1>/dev/null'

=item all_output

Intermixes lines of stdout and stderr in chronological order.
Like the Bourne shell redirect: '2>&1'

=item all_separated

The return will be an array reference with two elements: stdout and stderr.
(But under some circumstances, it may not be possible to seperate
the two, and all output will be returned intermixed, as the first
item, and the second will be undef.)

=back

=item autochomp

Set to a true value, causes all returned values to be
automatically chomped.  Defaults to false.

=item known_ways

List of known ways of invoking external commands, in the default
order in which they'll be tried (as of this writing: ['ex', 'ipc_cmd'].

=item ways

List of ways of invoking external commands, in the order the user
would like to try them.  Defaults to L</known_ways>.

=item way

Internal data structure used to store the result of the system probe
for functional ways.  This is a hashref, keyed by the allowed
values of the L</output_director>, to allow for odd cases where
different ways may work with different output_directors.

=item stdout_probe_messages

An array reference of a listing of messages which will be sent
to stdout by the probe sub-script

=back

Takes an optional hashref as an argument, with named fields
identical to the names of the object attributes.

# Note: "new" is inherited from Class::Base and
# calls the following "init" routine automatically.

=item init

Method that initializes object attributes and then locks them
down to prevent accidental creation of new ones.

Any class that inherits from this one should have an B<init> of
it's own that calls this B<init>.  Otherwise, it's an internally
used routine that is not of much interest to client coders.

=item define_yammer_script

This is an internally used routine, broken out as a method for
ease of testing.

This generates some code for the 'yammer_script' which is used
used by L</probe_system> to check which ways work for running
external commands.  The 'yammer_script' sends three lines of
output to stdout, and if provided with command-line arguments, it
will echo up to three of them to stderr.  The stderr output is
interleaved with the output sent to stdout, starting with stdout
(so the pattern is: OeOeOe).

This method uses the object data L</stdout_probe_messages> to get
an aref of messages to send to stdout; but this can be overridden
by passing it an aref of alternate messages.

So, just to make it clear: the STDOUT strings are defined when
this method is called, but the STDERR strings are defined only
when the yammer script it generates is run.

=head1 How It Works

Where possible, IPC::Capture will simply work by running the
given command in a sub-shell, invoked with a qx.

During the init phase, it tries to determine if a qx works as
expected (using Bourne-shell style redirects) by the expedient of
writing a temporary perl script that generates a known output,
and then just trying to run the script. (This step will be
skipped if the object is told which style of i/o it should use
when instantiated.)

It appears that qx with i/o re-direction is a relatively portable
idiom these days: it's supported by most forms of perl on
Windows, and I would be surprised if OSX does not support it
also.

If a qx fails, then this system will try another way of doing
the job using the L<IPC::Cmd> module.

If no way of running a simple command and capturing it's output
can be found, an error will be signalled during instantiation.

L<IPC::Cmd> in turn uses L<IPC::Run> or L<IPC::Open3> (depending
on which is installed), which means that this module should have
a fair degree of cross-platform portability.

=head2 further notes

Depending on the type of output requested with the "output_director",
this module will choose to do either a scalar or an array context call
to IPC::Cmd::run (insulating the user from one of IPC::Cmd's
oddities).

=head1 MOTIVATION

The original goal was to find something more portable than
shelling out via qx with Bourne shell redirection.

I'd just written the L<Emacs::Run> module that shells out to
emacs, and I was looking for improvements.  (Note: emacs is
a widely available program, with portability roughly on the
same scale as perl.)

The L<IPC::Cmd> module looked like a promising simplification
over directly using L<IPC::Run> or L<IPC::Open3>, but it's
output capture features seemed clumsy.

So: my first thought was to write a wrapper around the wrapper,
and as an added bonus, it would fall back on doing a simple qx
if L<IPC::Cmd> wasn't going to work.

My initial tests of that code immediately revealed a problem
with L<IPC::Cmd>: it usually worked as expected, but sometimes
would behave strangely (e.g. returning only one line of output
instead of the expected six; or instead of interleaving stderr
with stdout, it might return all stderr lines first).
My suspicion was that this was due to running on a perl with
threads enabled, but in any case, it didn't inspire confidence
with the idea that L<IPC::Cmd> was going to be more reliable than qx.

At which point, it occured to me that I could rewrite the
module to work the other way around: just use qx, but fall
back on L<IPC::Cmd>.  And indeed, it wasn't that difficult to
write probe routines to find out if qx works reliably.

All of this work seemed a little besides the point when I realized
that nearly every Windows installation of perl can deal with Bourne
shell redirects -- but still this module may very well improve
portability to some of the more unusual platforms such as VMS or
the older Macs.

And at the very least, if I use this module religiously, I can
stop worrying about mistyping '2>&1'.


=head1 TODO

o  More output_directors -- "output_to_file", etc.
   Add a general purpose, user-defineable one?

o  IPC::Cmd seems to have reliability problems (possibly, with
   multi-threaded perls?), the precise output it returns can vary
   from run to run.  Possibly: implement a voting algorithm, return
   the output most commonly recieved.

o  Better test coverage:  autochomp;  probe_system*;

o  02-can_run.t tests multiple internal routines, only one flavor of
   which need work for the overall behavior to work.  Should ship
   only with tests that verify the interface methods.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

There are possible security gotchas with using this module,
because it hands strings off to the shell to execute.  Any
commands built-up from user input should be scrubbed carefully
before being run with this module.  Using taint is strongly
recommended: see L<perlsec>.
