        - fixed a possible bug in tests: now explicitly uses the
          running perl ($^X) to run a sub-script, rather than
          relying on the hashbang line.

        - fixed test bug: ignore nonexistant directories in PATH
        - added more verbose output on some test failures for
          future debugging efforts.
